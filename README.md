# decompositions

CLONE the Repo using git-lfs! 

Use the connection_schematic.pdf to connect electonics, soundcard and comoputer. 

My personal suggestion is to move assets folder with 2 soundfiles to max folder - so it is neat and easy to adjust the folder path for the sounds in 'max/decompositions.maxpat'.


* make sure you adjust the serial port in `max/moistureSensor.maxpat`
* make sure you adjust the folder path for the sounds in `max/decompositions.maxpat`
* start decompositions with `max/decompositions.maxpat`

Soil - various (various colours for better way of illustrating earthworms burrows)
Distribution of the soil in the container - layers of various colours from top to bottom. Then around sides: 2 neighbouring sides:  dry soil and  2 remaining sides should house more of the moist soil.
The soil moisture sensors x 4 - each sensor goes inside each side of the container to monitor changing quality of soil (mixed and altered by moving Earthworms).

In addition to that we had 3 big suitcases of soil from the allotment/ garden and 2 suitcases with the sand from the local beach.
